## 1. Simulation

Ogata's modified thinning algorithm is used in this experiment to simulate the multi-dimensional Hawkes process. In the experiment, interval [0, 10000.0] was used as the simulation time range. 

The events in [0, 200.0] was plotted and here is the figure

The quantile-quantile plot of $\Lambda^k(T_{i-1}^k, T_i^k)$ against the exponential distribution was drawn and here is the figure

From above q-q plot, we know that the simulation is accurate. 

## 2. Fitting
